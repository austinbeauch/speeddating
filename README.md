# speeddating

A SENG474 final project created by [Kai Chao](https://github.com/KaiChao15), [Stephen Scinocca](https://github.com/StephenScinocca), and [Austin Beauchamp](https://github.com/austinbeauch).

We examine a [speed dating dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment) from Kaggle and build a model to predict how well someone will do on an average speed date based on their input data in five catagories. 

We have two models, one trained from an artificial neural net (see notebookes/ANN_input.ipynb) and a linear regression model (notebooks/LinearRegression.ipynb).

Running the ANN model requires Keras and can be tested with nn_app.py.
The linear regression model only requires Numpy and can be tested with regress_app.py.

The short report detailing our methods can be found within the report/ folder.
